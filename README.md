# EllixerEngine
Curent build = ALPHA 2
Elixer Engine is a game engine that I have writen in java. My goal for this game engine is for it to be effective, platform independent
and highly moddable. So far it is still in the works, check back for more!

What I have so far:
-simple 3d model rendering, more to come.
-simple ui, more to come
-start to an entity system, again more to come
